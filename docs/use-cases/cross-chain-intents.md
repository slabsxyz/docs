# Cross-chain Intents

Cross-chain intents refer to predefined actions or triggers that facilitate seamless interaction between multiple blockchain networks. As the blockchain ecosystem grows, interoperability between different chains becomes increasingly important, allowing assets, data, and transactions to move across platforms securely and efficiently.

In this use case, cross-chain intents allow decentralized applications (dApps) to execute complex, multi-step transactions involving multiple blockchains. For instance, a user could lock assets on one chain and trigger a corresponding action on another chain, such as unlocking liquidity or executing a trade. These intents are carried out autonomously by smart contracts or AI agents, creating a smooth and interconnected experience across disparate blockchain ecosystems.
