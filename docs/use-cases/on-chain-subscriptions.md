# On-chain Subscriptions

On-chain subscriptions allow users to subscribe to services, content, or utilities in a decentralized manner, with payments and access rights managed entirely by smart contracts. By leveraging the transparency and automation of blockchain technology, on-chain subscriptions remove the need for intermediaries and allow users to engage directly with service providers.

In this use case, AI agents can handle the subscription process autonomously, managing payments, renewals, and access rights. Verifiable computing ensures that the subscription conditions (such as payment frequency or access duration) are correctly enforced and auditable by all parties. This automation also ensures that the user experience is seamless, with smart contracts executing the required actions at each step of the subscription lifecycle.
