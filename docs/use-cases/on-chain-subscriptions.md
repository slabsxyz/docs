# On-Chain Subscriptions

Subscriptions have become a key model for accessing services in both Web2 and Web3. Functor Network enables **on-chain subscriptions**, allowing users to automate recurring payments and access services across multiple blockchains in a secure, decentralized manner.

## How On-Chain Subscriptions Work

- A user sets up a subscription through Functor, specifying the payment interval and the service they want to access.
- Functor’s **keystore** manages the recurring transaction process, ensuring that payments are made **automatically** from the user’s wallet without needing manual approval each time.
- Through **session keys**, Functor ensures that the subscription can only deduct funds based on predefined conditions, ensuring user control and security.

## Why On-Chain Subscriptions Are Important

- **Automation:** Users no longer need to manually approve each payment, making it easier to access decentralized services.
- **Cross-Chain Capability:** Subscriptions can be set up across multiple chains, allowing services that operate on different blockchains to be accessed seamlessly.
- **Security:** Session keys provide a secure way for payments to be authorized without exposing full control over a wallet’s funds.

On-chain subscriptions simplify the process of recurring payments in decentralized ecosystems, making it easier for users and businesses to interact with decentralized services.
