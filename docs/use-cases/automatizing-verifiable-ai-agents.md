# Automatizing Verifiable AI Agents

Functor Network enables AI agents to act **autonomously** while ensuring their actions are **verifiable**. The challenge of allowing AI to perform on-chain actions stems from the need to **trust** that the agentâ€™s decisions align with user intentions and blockchain rules.

## Why Verifiability Matters

AI agents can perform actions such as trading, staking, or managing assets across blockchains. However, without **cryptographic verification**, there's a risk that agents may behave unpredictably (or even maliciously). By using **session keys**, Functor ensures that AI agents operate within predefined parameters. These parameters are cross-chain readable and enforce **granular permissions** that are only valid for the specified time.

## How Functor Enables This

- **Session keys** act as temporary permissions that AI agents use to sign and verify transactions without exposing full control over wallets.
- Through **on-chain verification**, Functor protects against issues like AI agent hallucination, by ensuring that actions can be cryptographically verified.
- AI agents can collaborate in complex tasks across chains while maintaining strict control over asset management.

This allows dApps, users, and other AI agents to **trust** the actions of an AI agent without worrying about unforeseen behaviors.
