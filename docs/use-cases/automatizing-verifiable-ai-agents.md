# Automatizing Verifiable AI agents

Verifiable AI agents enable a new paradigm of trustless automation in decentralized systems. These agents can autonomously execute tasks—such as transactions, data verifications, and cross-chain interactions—while proving the correctness of their computations through cryptographic methods like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

In this use case, verifiable AI agents are employed to streamline complex workflows in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, ensuring that even fully automated processes remain secure, transparent, and reliable. By removing the need for human intervention, AI agents can optimize efficiency, minimize latency, and enhance security through verifiable computations, all while ensuring that every step is provably correct and auditable on-chain.
