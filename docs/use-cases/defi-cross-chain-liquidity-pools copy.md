# DeFi Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools

In decentralized finance (DeFi), **liquidity pools** are essential for enabling trades, loans, and other financial activities. Functor Network enhances this by enabling **cross-chain liquidity pools**, allowing assets to be seamlessly managed across multiple blockchains, improving access to liquidity.

## How Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools Work

- Functor Networkâ€™s keystore allows **liquidity providers** to manage assets across chains with a single, unified interface.
- Through **session keys**, Functor ensures that funds can be transferred and managed across chains without needing to maintain separate wallets or permissions for each blockchain.
- Cross-chain liquidity pools are updated in real-time, enabling fast transactions and **atomic swaps** across blockchains, reducing slippage and other risks associated with fragmented liquidity.

## Benefits of Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools

- **Greater access to liquidity:** Traders and dApps can tap into deeper liquidity across multiple blockchains, increasing the efficiency and profitability of trades.
- **Seamless management:** Liquidity providers can automate the management of their assets across chains, reducing the operational overhead and risks of managing multiple wallets.
- **Improved security:** Session keys allow for controlled access to assets, ensuring that funds are only moved or swapped based on predefined rules.

Cross-chain liquidity pools are a game-changer for DeFi, enabling decentralized markets to become more interconnected and efficient.
