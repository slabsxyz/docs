# DeFi: Cross Chain Liquidity Pools

Cross-chain liquidity pools in decentralized finance (DeFi) enable liquidity providers to pool assets across multiple blockchain networks, ensuring that liquidity can flow seamlessly between different chains. By doing so, DeFi applications can offer users better trading opportunities, lower slippage, and more efficient capital utilization.

In this use case, AI agents can monitor and automate the management of liquidity across chains. These agents dynamically adjust liquidity levels based on market conditions, moving assets between chains to optimize yield or reduce impermanent loss. Additionally, the use of zero-knowledge proofs ensures that liquidity movements are verifiable and trustless, even when interacting with multiple blockchains.
