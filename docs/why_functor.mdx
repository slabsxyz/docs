In practice, **Functor Network** acts as a **unified access layer for the autonomous world**, i.e a world safely assisted with AI agents, automatizing complex, data hungry tasks. 

<u>**Why is that?**</u>: We know that **Artificial intelligence (AI)** and **blockchain** intersect with **on-chain AI agents**, untapping markets such as:

- High speed & complex automatic trading with cross-chain liquidity
- Decentralized SaaS products with automatic & secure payment options, better customized based on consumer's behaviour.
- Richer intent engines with collaboration of multiple AI agent/oracles.
- AI-based dApps automation.

For this, we first need an infrastructure for these AI agents to act **verifiably**, **collaboratively** and **chain-agnostically**. To understand why these **are not** possible today, let's highlight the following limitations:

1. **Automation and transaction scheduling is <u>inconvenient</u> or <u>insecure</u>:** Today, for an AI agent to act on-chain, it requires either their own wallet with funds (inconvenient and more costly) or access to a signing key to produce transactions over our assets (insecure). 

2. **AI agents aren't perfect:** We know AI can't be ever perfect: It [hallucinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)) and give false positives/negatives. For it to be safely used, their computation must be verifiable cryptographically.

3. **Web3 is still fragmented:** To <u>*realistically*</u> automatize much of Web3 core processes, We need to first solve fragmentations such as liquidity across L2s, the need of having one wallet per chain and trust-less cross-chain [atomic transactions](/concepts/glossary/#atomic-transaction) (mainly for safe DeFi applications).

See [how functor is solving all of these](/how_functor).
