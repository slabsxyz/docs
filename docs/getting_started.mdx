**Functor Network** by [Security Labs](https://node.securitylabs.xyz/) is a **Keystore (KS) Rollup**:

:::info[Functor as a keystore Rollup]
A minimal decentralized [key/value database](/concepts/glossary/#key-value-store) to **store** and enable **cross-chain access** of:
- **Smart contract wallet (SCW) authentication parameters**, e.g.: 
  - Public keys, 
  - Passkeys, 
  - Signature thresholds, any other scheme-specific parameters
- [**Session keys**](/concepts/glossary/#session-key), e.g.:
  - Permissions over assets
  - Expiration conditions
  - Authentication parameters for specific situations
- And, **any** other configurations you want **[atomically](/concepts/glossary/#atomic-transaction) updated across any L2**, e.g. updates to cross-chain protocols
:::

Functor decouples **authentication logic** from **execution logic**. This means: <u>Configure your smart contract **once** and have it updated **everywhere**.</u>

## Why is this important?
Some immediate benefits, as outlined by [Vitalik in his origial post discussing the idea](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/06/09/three_transitions.html), come with key recovery; i.e. Changing the authentication to access your assets — important when your credentials have been compromised or just lost. Here's a summary:

1. <u>**Updating cross-chain is costly:**</u> With Functor, only one update is needed for all chains, bundling multiple updates in a batch of zero-knowledge proofs, making it even cheaper.

2. <u>**Updates are not [atomic](/concepts/glossary/#atomic-transaction):**</u> Meaning the update can happen in some chains and not in others, since updating is manual. With Functor, either all updates happen, or none happen: Not partial updates. 

3. <u>**Counterfactual addresses aren't updated:**</u> Counteractual refers to accounts that would be yours in other chains when you decide to use them. This include chains that doesn't even exist[^1]. With Functor, all your new accounts, even before you decide to use them, will be up-to-date with your credentials — ready to use.

4. <u>**Cross-chain accounts are currently not privacy friendly:**</u> If a user intentionally has many addresses to avoid linking them to each other, they certainly do not want to publicly link all of them by recovering them at or around the same time! With Functor, the update happens uncorrelated to the addresses of the accounts benefitting with the update, preserving privacy.

[^1]: This is possible thanks to SCW being created with `CREATE2`, which is deterministic.
