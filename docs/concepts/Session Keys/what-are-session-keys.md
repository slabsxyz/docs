# What are session keys?

Session keys are temporary cryptographic keys generated for the purpose of securing a communication session. Unlike long-term keys stored in keystore networks, session keys are only valid for the duration of a particular session, after which they are discarded.

Session keys are typically used in situations where short-term security is paramount, such as securing a dApp transaction or communication between two users. Their short lifespan makes them highly effective at preventing long-term exposure or misuse in the event of a security breach. Session keys provide an essential layer of security in decentralized networks by ensuring that even compromised data is time-limited in its utility.
