# Threat Model

Session keys are a foundational component of many cryptographic protocols, providing temporary security for communication channels. However, they are subject to various threats, including:

1. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Intercepting communication to gain access to session keys.
2. Key Leakage: Unintended exposure of session keys, compromising security for the duration of the session.
3. Replay Attacks: Reusing old session keys to impersonate valid users and replay previously valid transactions.
4. Session Hijacking: Taking control of an active session by stealing or guessing session keys.

This threat model outlines the main vectors of attack on session keys and provides strategies for mitigating these risks, including regular key rotation, secure key exchanges, and implementing short expiration times for session keys.
