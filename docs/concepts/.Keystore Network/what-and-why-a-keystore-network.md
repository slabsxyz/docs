# What and why a keystore network?

A keystore network is a decentralized system designed to securely store, manage, and retrieve cryptographic keys. Cryptographic keys are essential for performing secure transactions and interacting with smart contracts. In decentralized systems, ensuring the security and availability of these keys is paramount.

By using a decentralized keystore network, users can trust that their cryptographic keys are stored safely and redundantly across multiple nodes. This eliminates the risk of single points of failure and ensures that keys are always accessible when needed. Keystore networks are critical for applications requiring long-term key storage, such as digital identity systems and wallet infrastructures.
