# Session Store Network

The Sessionstore network is designed to securely manage and store temporary cryptographic keys that are essential for securing communication in decentralized environments. Unlike permanent keystore networks, which manage long-term keys, Sessionstore focuses on managing short-lived keysâ€”often referred to as session keys.

These session keys provide a lightweight and secure way to encrypt data for a specific period of time. Once the session expires, the keys are discarded, ensuring that even if a key is compromised, its utility is limited to the duration of the session. This system is ideal for securing dApp interactions where short-term security is critical.
