# Minimal key-value store blockchain

A minimal key-value store blockchain represents the simplest form of a blockchain that supports basic storage and retrieval of data. By utilizing a minimalist architecture, these blockchains focus on achieving high performance and scalability with reduced complexity. Each key represents a unique identifier for data, while the corresponding value is the data stored at that location.

In systems like keystore rollups, this model allows for efficient storage of cryptographic keys, ensuring fast access, retrieval, and management. With low overhead, minimal key-value store blockchains can support a variety of decentralized applications (dApps) and use cases.
