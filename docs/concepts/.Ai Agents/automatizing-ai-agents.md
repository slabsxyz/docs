# Automatizing AI agents

AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize blockchain systems by enabling full automation of smart contract interactions. These agents can execute tasks autonomously, leveraging on-chain data and programmable permissions. In an environment where speed and verifiability are paramount, AI agents can automate complex decision-making processes, driving transactions and state changes at unprecedented speeds.

By utilizing oracles and permission systems, AI agents can access external information, while zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) ensure the security and privacy of their interactions. This automation enables decentralized applications (dApps) to operate without human intervention, creating faster, more efficient, and secure systems for a wide array of use cases, from DeFi to supply chain management.
