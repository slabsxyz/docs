# Verifiable Computing

Verifiable computing is a critical component in trustless blockchain ecosystems. When AI agents interact with smart contracts, it is vital that the outcomes of their computations are verifiable by all participants. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), AI agents can provide cryptographic evidence of their computations, ensuring that results are accurate without needing full data disclosure.

This mechanism empowers decentralized applications (dApps) to scale and automate complex transactions, ensuring that all operations remain secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Verifiable computing is thus the backbone of the AI agent economy, fostering trust and reliability in a decentralized world.
