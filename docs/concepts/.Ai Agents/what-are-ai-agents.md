# What are AI agents?

AI agents are autonomous programs designed to operate within blockchain environments. These agents can perform complex tasks—such as executing smart contract logic, verifying data, and interacting with oracles—without human intervention. AI agents unlock unprecedented capabilities in the blockchain space, allowing for fully automated, decentralized applications (dApps) to run smoothly and efficiently.

Through the integration of fast cryptographic primitives and verifiable computation, AI agents can make real-time decisions, automate transactions, and streamline blockchain interactions, enhancing the speed, security, and scalability of the underlying network.
