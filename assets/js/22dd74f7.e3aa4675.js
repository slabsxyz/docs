However, the number of people who understand and can write zk circuits is small. This barrier to developers risks reduced adoption of the Keystore Rollup.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/intro":{"id":"architecture/intro","title":"Intro to architecture","description":"Key Management Abstraction (KMA) removes the complexities for users to manage (store, backup/retrieve, rotate, import/export, etc.) private keys in a secure way. The kind of complexities and what security exactly means is discussed as follows:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Intro to Functor","description":"What is Functor Network?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"use-cases/automatizing-verifiable-ai-agents":{"id":"use-cases/automatizing-verifiable-ai-agents","title":"Automatizing Verifiable AI agents","description":"Verifiable AI agents enable a new paradigm of trustless automation in decentralized systems.
